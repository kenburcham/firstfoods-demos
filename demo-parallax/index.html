        <h2>Columbia Basin Fish Accords </h2>
        <p>In 2008, CTUIR signed the Columbia Basin Fish Accords along with Warm Springs, Yakama, Colville tribes and BPA, securing $900 million for salmon restoration projects throughout the Columbia River Basin.
        The First Foods Policy Department counts this as one of their greatest achievements.</p>

        <h2>Habitat Restoration Projects</h2>
        <p>In 2009, the Fisheries department kicked off restoration projects across the 5 subbasins.
        Habitat restoration is an essential part of the First Foods plan to protect and enhance fish populations by providing healthy habitat and
        reducing stream tempturatures for fish viability. More fish mean more harvest opportunities.</p>

        <h2>Water Pollution Laws Enacted</h2>
        <p>CTUIR First Foods Policy department collaborated with Oregon Department of Environmental Quality and the EPA to set new standards for fish consumption to better protect Indian health. In 2011,
          water quality standards were adopted by Oregon and approved by the EPA that
          increased the daily fish consumption rate from 17.5g to 175g based on Indian fish consumption rates. This is very significant because fish consumption is used to calculate allowable polution in the water.</p>

        <h2>Data Management Improvement Project</h2>
        <p>In 2013-14, DNR partnered with GIS and others to conduct a comprehensive data management needs assessment. Groups across DNR worked to standardize their protocols and parameters and
          built a system for storing and reporting data called the CDMS. Improved data quality and accessibility is resulting in better informed decisions for natural resource management.</p>
